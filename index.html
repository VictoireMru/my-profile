		<h1>Hello, I'm Victoire</h1>
		<img src="images/profile.jpeg" alt="Victoire Moreau">

		<h2>TRIATHLON</h2>
		<p>I competed in triathlon for 6 years. It's a sport that I love, mixing 3 sports at the same time. Unfortunately, I stopped this year due to my studies but I continue to run!</p>

	<div class="Travel box">
		<h2>TRAVEL</h2>
		<p>I love traveling because traveling allows me to discover new cultures, explore unknown horizons and open myself to different perspectives. They also give me the opportunity to break out of my routine, to learn and grow through unique experiences.</p>

	<div class="Ski box">
		<h2>SKI</h2>
		<p>I love skiing for the feeling of freedom that comes from sliding in the heart of nature, surrounded by spectacular mountainous landscapes. I've been doing it since I was 3 years old. It's also an activity that allows me to push myself physically while enjoying the adrenaline and pleasure of going down the slopes.</p>
